You should modify build.xml to have a good classpath. Put jlatexmath-fop.jar and jlatexmath.jar in your fop/lib.

To see it in action, go to the directory examples and type :

fop -c conf.xml -fo latex.fo -pdf latex.pdf

The file conf.xml is needed to autodetect the embedded fonts in the jlatexmath.jar.

Have fun !
