You should modify the file fop.properties to have good path : jlatexmath-0.8.8, fop 0.95 and xmlgraphics-commons-1.3.1 are required to compile jlatexmath-fop. In fact the version 0.95 is essentially required to handle embedded fonts which are in jlatexmath.jar  

Put jlatexmath-fop.jar and jlatexmath.jar in your fop/lib.

To see it in action, go to the directory examples and read the README.

Have fun !
